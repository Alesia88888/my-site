<h1>What are SDLC model types?</h1>
<p>In our previous article we've seen how a standard or basic SDLC model looks like and it was mentioned that nowadays a lot of SDLC models has evolved to make software development more efficient.</p>
<div class="article_item">
<img src="img/blog/SDLC_models/waterfall.png" height= "350px" width="350px">
<h2>Waterfall model</h2>
<p>In Waterfall each project phase is gone through just once following one after another. Before starting a new phase, the previous one shall be finished.</p>
<ul><b>Advantages:</b>
<li>good for projects with stable and non-changeable requirements.</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Disadvantages:</b>
<li>impossible to change requirements when development has started;</li>
<li>testing phase starts only after all development services are finished;</li>
<li>customers will see the product only at the end of a project.</li>
</ul>
<p>This model is appropriate for construction or projects where preparatory detailed analysis and panning play critical role.
  For instance, if we are building a car all requirements shall be known and well analyzed in the beginning, planning shall be detailed, also there is no possibility to properly test everything before vital components like barking system is being developed.</p>
</div>






<div class="article_item">
  <img src="img/blog/SDLC_models/incremental.png" height= "350px" width="350px">
  <h2>Incremental model</h2>
  <p>In increment model system requirements are defined in the very beginning and then development made for modules of the system which follow one by one. Each of those models is a completed and function-able piece of software.</p>
  <ul><b>Advantages:</b>
  <li> possibility to get feedback from the customer for each developed model;</li>
  <li> possibility to make adjustments to schedule.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul><b>Disadvantages:</b>
  <li> system functionality has to be clearly defined in the beginning of a project;</li>
  <li> continuous changes might disrupt the system architecture.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This methodology is good where all the requirements are clear at the very start and where system can be devided in modules.</p>
  </div>







  <div class="article_item">
    <img src="img/blog/SDLC_models/iterative.png" height= "350px" width="350px">
  <h2>Iterative model </h2>

  <p>Instead one round of steps as it is in Waterfall, iterative development cycle is divided into small mini cycles. End each of those mini cycles consist of the same steps as in a basic SDLC. Mini cycles are called iterations. In each iteration a development of an individual component of a system is done and then added to previously developed components.</p>
  <ul><b>Advantages: </b>
  <li> early development of working software;</li>
  <li> possibility to make changes on all stages of a project;</li>
  <li> each iteration is like a small step for which is easier to test and analyze.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul><b>Disadvantages: </b>
  <li> might be issues with realization of general architecture, while not all the requirements are known in the beginning.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Iterative model suits large projects, where not all requirements are known in the very beginning of a project and when those requirements might change later.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="article_item">
    <img src="img/blog/SDLC_models/agile.png" height= "350px" width="350px">
  <h2>Agile</h2>
  <p>Agile is a very popular model nowadays as it allows to develop software features and get feedback from a customer early which will likely to lead to successful project realization, a working software is delivered to the customer early as well. According to this methodology you can start a project even if not all the requirements are known. This methodology is a combination of both - incremental and iterative. The modules or functions are developed separately and go through all stages of a standard SDLC. At the end of each iteration there is a working piece of software that a customer reviews and gives feedback.</p>
  <ul><b>Advantages:</b>
  <li>customer is involved in product development from very beginning;</li>
  <li>early feedback from a customer and customer satisfaction is bigger;</li>
  <li>requires minimum resources;</li>
  <li>early release of working features;</li>
  <li>adaptive to changing requirements.</li>

  </ul>
  <ul><b>Disadvantages:</b>
  <li>communication with customers has to be establish very well and there shall be frequent feedback from them;</li>
  <li>requires high professionalism from a team;</li>
  <li>might be tricky when there are dependencies between features in software product;</li>
  <li>knowledge transfer to new team members requires more effort.</li>
  </ul>
</div>




<div class="article_item">
  <img src="img/blog/SDLC_models/vmodel.png" height= "350px" width="350px">
<h2>V-model</h2>

<p>There is particular emphasis on quality and testing in V model that start early along with requirements gathering. It means that once requirements gathering has started, test plan on how requirements will be checked is being developed. And for each next stage its own testing phase is planned. On the left side of V we can see the stages of development - on the right side - stages of testing activities. </p>

<ul><b>Advantages: </b>
<li> emphasis on quality of software;</li>
<li> defects can be found on early stage.</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Disadvantages:</b>
<li> difficulty in making changes on later stages of the development process.</li>
</ul>
<p>V-shaped model is good for small to medium size projects with special emphasis on quality, where requirements are well known and understood in the beginning of a project, and technical resources (QA specialists in particular) are sufficient. </p>

<div class="article_item">
<img src="img/blog/SDLC_models/spiral.jpg" height= "350px" width="350px">
<h2>Spiral model</h2>
<p>Spiral model is very similar to incremental and its peculiarity is a high emphasis on risk analysis.
It is a combination of both waterfall and prototype models and the project is evolving all the time. </p>
<ol><b>It consists of 4 steps:</b>
<li> Objective determination & identification of alternative solutions;</li>
<li> Risk analysis;</li>
<li> Development;</li>
<li> Planning of the next phase.</li>
</ol>
<ul><b>Advantages:</b>
<li>possibility make changes to the requirements;</li>
<li>requirements can be gathered in a more accurate way;</li>
<li>risky parts are analyzed in detail can be developed early;</li>
<li>prototypes can be used.</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Disadvantages:</b>
<li> more complex process and more management is required;</li>
<li>excessive documentation;</li>
<li>not suitable for small and low risk projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>This model will be most appropriate for large projects, where each next step requires more analysis than a previous one. It it might be the right model for such projects as for instance development of document work flow system for a bank. </p>

<h2>RAD model</h2>
<p>RAD which is abbreviated as Rapid Application Development Model, is based on the concepts of both iterative and prototyping models. A great attention is paid to the customerâ€™s feedback and development starts with building prototypes of software modules. Those modules are developed in parallel and then assembled together in a form of a working prototype. It is important to make sure that the prototypes are reusable.</p>
<ul><b>Advantages:</b>
<li>early feedback from a customer;</li>
<li>product is more likely will be up-to date, while it will be developed quickly;</li>
<li>project can start without all the requirements are being known;</li>
<li>project can be completed in a short period of time.</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Disadvantages:</b>
<li>dependency on strong technical team to get business requirements in short time;</li>
<li>only for products that can be build in modules;</li>
<li>automated resources are often required.</li>
</ul>
<p>For projects approx. up to 3 month where several dev teams can work on different prototyping elements. Only for projects where system can be developed in modules. There shall be possibility to scale the system.</p>
</div>



<div class="article_item">
<h2>Big bang model</h2>
<p>This type of model requires little planning and does not follow any process. It just starts when there are resources for it.</p>
<ul><b>Advantages:</b>
<li>simplicity;</li>
<li>no planning is required;</li>
<li>very few resources are required;</li>
<li>gives flexibility to developers.</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Disadvantages:</b>
<li>high risk and uncertainty;</li>
<li>not suitable for complex projects; </li>
<li>customers may receive not what they were expecting. </li>
</ul>
<p>This model is good only for some experimental development in learning purposes, otherwise it may bring great expenses.</p>
</div>





<div class="article_item">
<h2>Prototype model</h2>
<p>This model requires building a prototype at the beginning of the process, however the prototype may not always have the same logic as final product.</p>
<ul><b>Advantages:</b>
<li>customer is involved in product development from very beginning;</li>
<li>early feedback from a customer;</li>
<li>if there are missing requirements, they will be clarified;</li>
<li>early identification of bugs.</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Disadvantages:</b>
<li>too much dependency on a prototype which might be not technically perfect;</li>
<li>complexity increases;</li>
<li>additional resources are required.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>We've seen the most famous SDLC models that are used now in project management. It usually depends on a project and circumsances which one is the best.
  To choose the right one you have to analyze all advantages and disadvantages to make a right choice.
