    <h1>What does SDLC mean?</h1>
    <p>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process that consist of six steps during which software product is being developed and each software system shall pass all those phases</p>
<p>Let’s see in general what those steps are, keeping in mind that all system differ by their level of complexity, components and expected functionality.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Requirements Gathering and Analysis</h2>
<p>Every software development process starts with gathering general requirements from a customer and understanding what customer’s problems and expectations are. Usually then follows a technical and economical analysis to prove that the project can be executed and it will bring social or economic value. Once these analyses are completed, the Software Requirement Specification is being prepared for customer’s approval where all requirements are collected and prioritized. Requirements are also analyzed to have possibility being tested in the future stages. For instance, if we mention in requirements that a system shall work fast, we shall specify the exact measure of it, as different people might have their own understanding of what is fast.</p>   
<p> It is important to mention that on this particular stage the communication shall be established well with the customer to ensure that a customer and dev team have same view on the features, functions and characteristics of a future product.</p> 
<h2>Step 2: Planning </h2>
<p>Planning is a critical step in successful product development. In this phase you decide and plan how you will build a product. Main actions include:
<ul>
 <li>defining problems, goals and resources;</li>
 <li>explore possibilities of alternative solutions;</li>  
 <li>examine ways of making you product better than competitors;</li> 
</ul>
<p>Once those analyses are completed, you will also have a clear idea whether you will need to improve an existing product or system, develop a new one or just to leave everything as it is.</p>
 

<p>Technical feasibility study might be conducted to define which stack of technology would be the most beneficial and appropriate for a project taking into account time and budget constrains. Project risks are identified on this stage and project manager with the team monitors them during all the subsequent steps of SDLC with the aim to avoid or address them. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Design of the system</h2>
<p>After requirements analysis and planning are done and there is a clear understanding on what the customer needs, design of the system or architecture analysis begins. On this stage elements and components, level of security, modules, architecture,   are clarified, data types of the system.</p>
<p>General and preliminary design can be made just on a list of paper. Then more detailed analysis is done including all the technical and functional requirements. </p> 
<p>Design serves as a guideline for the software developers which clarifies what shall be built, in which way and using what technologies.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Software Development</h2>
<p>This is where actual development starts. If the Architecture design is done in a proper and detailed way, coding is performed without much hassle.
During this stage developers analyze the  and generate coding based on general requirements of a specific programming language and organizational requirements. Also this stage includes integration all the components that have been developed.</p>




<h2>Step 5: Testing</h2> 
<p>As it was mentioned before, testing is conducted based on requirements that have been gathered and documented. Testers check if the product has been developed according to those requirements and if it works properly. When bugs are found in the system, they are reported to the developers for fixing and then testing continues until the product works without flaws and reaches the standards required.</p>
<h2>Step 6: Deployment</h2> 
<p>After testing the product may reach a small segment of people on the market or in a company to perform additional testing by real users of the product or it may go straight to the market. Once it is done usually some technical support or maintenance is required to the existing customers.</p>

<p>We’ve walked through a basic model of Software Development Life Cycle, however there are different types of SDLC for different project methodologies which we will see in the upcoming posts.</p>
